1. The general trend in the curve is a positive relationship. It seems that
as the percentage of data used for training increases, so does the accuracy
on the test set. This makes sense because if there is more training data
then it makes sense that there would also be more accuracy with the test set.

2. It seems the lower half of the data set is noisier than the part on the
upper portion of the curve. I am guessing that this is because when there is
so little training data, it could work out really well and have good accuracy
on the testing set or it could end up having really poor accuracy. I am guessing
that this explains the wider variability when there is less training data.

3. It seems like the curve smooths out after about 100 trials.

4. A larger C value means that you need to use less training data to get a
higher accuracy on the testing set. It seems if you make the C value too small
(ie 10^-20) it never increases in accuracy as much as it does with a larger
C value.
